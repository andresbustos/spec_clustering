#Spectrogram Clustering

####spectrogram_representation.py

This script contains a class called 'spectrogram' that calculates the embedding of a set of images and clusters it using several methods.

A dataset of 500 spectrogramas is included in the repository. The dile 'data.tar' must be unpacked so it can be used.

We have to specify the folder with png input spectrograms, the file with the discharge heating information and theoutput folder.

After the class definition there are some lines showing how to use the class.
